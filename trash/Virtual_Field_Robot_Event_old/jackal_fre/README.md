======

This package contains a copy of the [clearpath Jackal package](https://github.com/jackal/jackal). Minor modifications are applied to reflect to robot available on the event. 

Also a copy of the [lms1xx package](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/LMS1xx/tree/melodic-devel) is included. This package is modified to use the GPU lidar gazebo plugin, instead of the CPU gazbeo plugin.
